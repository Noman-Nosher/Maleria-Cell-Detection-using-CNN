# Maleria-Cell-Detection-using-CNN
Malaria is a contagious disease that affects millions of lives every year. Traditional diagnosis of malaria in laboratory requires an experienced person and careful inspection to discriminate healthy and infected red blood cells (RBCs). It is also very time-consuming and may produce inaccurate reports due to human errors. Cognitive computing and deep learning algorithms simulate human intelligence to make better human decisions in applications like sentiment analysis, speech recognition, face detection, disease detection, and prediction. Due to the advancement of cognitive computing and machine learning techniques, they are now widely used to detect and predict early disease symptoms in healthcare field. With the early prediction results, healthcare professionals can provide better decisions for patient diagnosis and treatment. Machine learning algorithms also aid the humans to process huge and complex medical datasets and then analyze them into clinical insights. This work will help to detect malaria cell using CNN model.
